/*
You've been asked to add a feature to your company's software. The feature is intended to improve the renewal rate of subscriptions to the software. Your task is to display a renewal message when a user logs into the software system and is notified their subscription will soon end. You'll need to add a couple of decision statements to properly add branching logic to the application to satisfy the requirements.

    Rule 1: Your code should only display one message.

    The message that your code displays will depend on the other five rules. For rules 2-6, the higher numbered rules take precedence over the lower numbered rules.

    Rule 2: If the user's subscription will expire in 10 days or less, display the message:

    Your subscription will expire soon. Renew now!

    Rule 3: If the user's subscription will expire in five days or less, display the messages:

    Your subscription expires in _ days.
    Renew now and save 10%!

    Rule 4: If the user's subscription will expire in one day, display the messages:

    Your subscription expires within a day!
    Renew now and save 20%!

    Rule 5: If the user's subscription has expired, display the message:

    Your subscription has expired.

    Rule 6: If the user's subscription doesn't expire in 10 days or less, display nothing.
